# TheatersArtsProgram
This project is about theater arts website buying events or checking the website.
In order to run the website, you need XAMPP application installed.
Once installed, Enable MySQL and Apache from XAMPP Menu.

Any php, html, css files should be placed inside the htdocs file in folder location of XAMPP main to functional as intended.
Once the websites are created, type in any search engine url localhost/(name of file).html  
This will open up the webpage of the file.

As for the database PhPMyAdmin (MySQL), in order to access it, type in search engine url localhost/phpmyadmin 
this will prompt opening database manager. From there, you may create a new database, name it, and put new types of variables integer or char within.
Save the file for it to work.

can be used.
